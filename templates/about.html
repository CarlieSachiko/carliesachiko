    <i>Hi there, I'm Carlie - hapa, Californian, unprofessional photographer, and web developer.</i><br><br>
    My entry into and passion for programming was much like the $20 you found in your pocket. Unexpected and terribly exciting. With my "$20" in hand, I dove into General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program after graduating from Pepperdine University, dedicating myself to over 600 hours of learning numerous web development languages and technologies.<br><br>

    A curious soul with an eagerness to grow, I approach opportunities with flexibility and an open mind. I bring right brain creativity and left brain analytics to balance in my work, keenly focusing on the smaller details and producing quality work. As I venture into the development world, I am anxious to build upon the knowledge I have already gained and am driven by a passion to make a positive impact in this world, as cliche as that sounds.<br><br>

    I'm ready to hit the ground running.<br><br>
